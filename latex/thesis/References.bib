  abstract = {Distributions of open source software packages dedicated to specific programming languages facilitate software development by allowing software projects to depend on the functionality provided by such reusable packages. The health of a software project can be affected by the maturity of the packages on which it depends. The version numbers of the used package releases provide an indication of their maturity. Packages with a 0.y.z version number are commonly assumed to be under initial development, suggesting that they are likely to be less stable, and depending on them may be considered as less healthy. In this paper, we empirically study, for four open source package distributions (Cargo, npm, Packagist and RubyGems ) to which extent 0.y.z package releases and {$\geq$}1.0.0 package releases behave differently. We quantify the prevalence of 0.y.z releases, we explore how long packages remain in the initial development stage, we compare the update frequency of 0.y.z and {$\geq$}1.0.0 package releases, we study how often 0.y.z releases are required by other packages, we assess whether semantic versioning is respected for dependencies towards them, and we compare some characteristics of 0.y.z and {$\geq$}1.0.0 package repositories hosted on GitHub. Among others, we observe that package distributions are more permissive than what semantic versioning dictates for 0.y.z releases, and that many of the 0.y.z releases can actually be regarded as mature packages. As a consequence, the version number does not provide a good indication of the maturity of a package release.},

It is defined as the arithmetic mean of the clustering coefficients of its vertices, where the clustering coefficient of a vertex \$u\$ of \$G\$ is the relative density \$m(G[N\_G(u)])/\{d\_G(u)\textbackslash choose 2\}\$ of its neighborhood if \$d\_G(u)\$ is at least \$2\$, and \$0\$ otherwise. It is unknown which graphs maximize the clustering coefficient among all connected graphs of given order and size. We determine the maximum clustering coefficients among all connected regular graphs of a given order, as well as among all connected subcubic graphs of a given order. In both cases, we characterize all extremal graphs. Furthermore, we determine the maximum increase of the clustering coefficient caused by adding a single edge.},

  abstract = {Knowledge about the roles developers play in a software project is crucial to understanding the project's collaborative dynamics. Developers are often classified according to the dichotomy of core and peripheral roles. Typically, operationalizations based on simple counts of developer activities (e.g., number of commits) are used for this purpose, but there is concern regarding their validity and ability to elicit meaningful insights. To shed light on this issue, we investigate whether commonly used operationalizations of core--peripheral roles produce consistent results, and we validate them with respect to developers' perceptions by surveying 166 developers. Improving over the state of the art, we propose a relational perspective on developer roles, using developer networks to model the organizational structure, and by examining core--peripheral roles in terms of developers' positions and stability within the organizational structure. In a study of 10 substantial open-source projects, we found that the existing and our proposed core--peripheral operationalizations are largely consistent and valid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a relational perspective can reveal further meaningful insights, such as that core developers exhibit high positional stability, upper positions in the hierarchy, and high levels of coordination with other core developers.},

For example, Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox release new versions every 6 weeks. These shorter release cycles reduce the users' waiting time for a new release and offer better marketing opportunities to companies, but it is unclear if the quality of the software product improves as well, since shorter release cycles result in shorter testing periods. In this paper, we empirically study the development process of Mozilla Firefox in 2010 and 2011, a period during which the project transitioned to a shorter release cycle. We compare crash rates, median uptime, and the proportion of post-release bugs of the versions that had a shorter release cycle with those having a traditional release cycle, to assess the relation between release cycle length and the software quality observed by the end user. We found that (1) with shorter release cycles, users do not experience significantly more post-release bugs and (2) bugs are fixed faster, yet (3) users experience these bugs earlier during software execution (the program crashes earlier).},

The clustering coefficient, reflecting the local configuration of triangles, can be seen as a special case of this approach. In this paper we generalize this method for weighted networks. We introduce subgraph ``intensity'' as the geometric mean of its link weights and ``coherence'' as the ratio of the geometric to the corresponding arithmetic mean. Using these measures, motif scores and clustering coefficient can be generalized to weighted networks. To demonstrate these concepts, we apply them to financial and metabolic networks and find that inclusion of weights may considerably modify the conclusions obtained from the study of unweighted characteristics.},

We show that these two features are the consequence of a hierarchical organization, implying that small groups of nodes organize in a hierarchical manner into increasingly large groups, while maintaining a scale-free topology. In hierarchical networks, the degree of clustering characterizing the different groups follows a strict scaling law, which can be used to identify the presence of a hierarchical organization in real networks. We find that several real networks, such as the Worldwideweb, actor network, the Internet at the domain level, and the semantic web obey this scaling law, indicating that hierarchy is a fundamental characteristic of many complex systems.},
