  abstract = {Knowledge about the roles developers play in a software project is crucial to understanding the project's collaborative dynamics. Developers are often classified according to the dichotomy of core and peripheral roles. Typically, operationalizations based on simple counts of developer activities (e.g., number of commits) are used for this purpose, but there is concern regarding their validity and ability to elicit meaningful insights. To shed light on this issue, we investigate whether commonly used operationalizations of core--peripheral roles produce consistent results, and we validate them with respect to developers' perceptions by surveying 166 developers. Improving over the state of the art, we propose a relational perspective on developer roles, using developer networks to model the organizational structure, and by examining core--peripheral roles in terms of developers' positions and stability within the organizational structure. In a study of 10 substantial open-source projects, we found that the existing and our proposed core--peripheral operationalizations are largely consistent and valid. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a relational perspective can reveal further meaningful insights, such as that core developers exhibit high positional stability, upper positions in the hierarchy, and high levels of coordination with other core developers.},

  abstract = {The local structure of unweighted networks can be characterized by the number of times a subgraph appears in the network. The clustering coefficient, reflecting the local configuration of triangles, can be seen as a special case of this approach. In this paper we generalize this method for weighted networks. We introduce subgraph ``intensity'' as the geometric mean of its link weights and ``coherence'' as the ratio of the geometric to the corresponding arithmetic mean. Using these measures, motif scores and clustering coefficient can be generalized to weighted networks. To demonstrate these concepts, we apply them to financial and metabolic networks and find that inclusion of weights may considerably modify the conclusions obtained from the study of unweighted characteristics.},

  abstract = {Many real networks in nature and society share two generic properties: they are scale-free and they display a high degree of clustering. We show that these two features are the consequence of a hierarchical organization, implying that small groups of nodes organize in a hierarchical manner into increasingly large groups, while maintaining a scale-free topology. In hierarchical networks, the degree of clustering characterizing the different groups follows a strict scaling law, which can be used to identify the presence of a hierarchical organization in real networks. We find that several real networks, such as the Worldwideweb, actor network, the Internet at the domain level, and the semantic web obey this scaling law, indicating that hierarchy is a fundamental characteristic of many complex systems.},
