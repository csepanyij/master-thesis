  abstract = {Software development is incredibly complex. Specifically, Open Source Software development requires developers to collaborate with each other to conduct their work. Because software systems are evolving with time, collaboration among software developers may affect the quality of evolved software. The OSS developer teams collaborate in various tasks, including communications, coordination, and making various social collaboration in the open source software projects (e.g., Bug/issue report, discussion, code revisions, etc.) without access restriction, and all these activities are used to generate an implicit developer social network (DSN). The DSN that is based on a bug tracking system is one of the most important DSNs that reflect the real collaboration between developers. As the software system evolves, the DSN evolves. This paper describes an empirical study of the evolution of DSNs on open source software projects collected from GitHub. Four perspectives were used: Social Network Analysis (SNA), DSN as an ecosystem, community evolution patterns, and the core-periphery structure. The results demonstrated the DSNs over time have followed the power law degree distribution with +1\% or more as an increasing rate to be more fitting over time. DSNs over time are considered a small world community. DSNs over time exhibits about 55\% diversity with 75\% of evenness between developers to contribute in different OSS projects in the same environment. Moreover, DSNs over time have a few developers as core members and large developers as peripheral members. Finally, about 10\% of developers changed their positions frequently over time.},

  abstract = {The work presented in this paper is focused on the Open Source Software (OSS) community structure, with particular emphasis on the Concurrent Versions System (CVS) and Subversion (SVN) datasets used to produce the network structure. The theme of the work in this paper is the dynamics of these networks over time. Much research has been done analyzing the network structure at some particular point in time or the network formed by conflating connections made over a specific time span. We present a review of OSS research using CVS/SVN data. We provide an introduction to complex networks as it relates to the open source software community and the numerous studies analyzing networks formed by different software communities, such as SourceForge and GNU Savannah. We also present an initial analysis of the developer and project networks for BerliOS Developer, SourceForge, and GNU Savannah. We also present the results of a study on the importance of social network structure as an indicator of long-term project success. We propose work relating to the evolution of open source software networks as well as the importance of the dynamic network structure.}

  abstract = {Truck Factor (TF) is a metric proposed by the agile community as a tool to identify concentration of knowledge in software development environments. It states the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a truck (or quit) before a project is incapacitated. In other words, TF helps to measure how prepared is a project to deal with developer turnover. Despite its clear relevance, few studies explore this metric. Altogether there is no consensus about how to calculate it, and no supporting evidence backing estimates for systems in the wild. To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel (and automated) approach for estimating TF-values, which we execute against a corpus of 133 popular project in GitHub. We later survey developers as a means to assess the reliability of our results. Among others, we find that the majority of our target systems (65\%) have TF {$<$}= 2. Surveying developers from 67 target systems provides confidence towards our estimates; in 84\% of the valid answers we collect, developers agree or partially agree that the TF's authors are the main authors of their systems; in 53\% we receive a positive or partially positive answer regarding our estimated truck factors.},

Any structure that exists is dynamic, self-organizing, latent, and usually not explicitly stated. Still, in large, complex, successful, OSS projects, we do expect that subcommunities will form spontaneously within the developer teams. Studying these subcommunities, and their behavior can shed light on how successful OSS projects self-organize. This phenomenon could well hold important lessons for how commercial software teams might be organized. Building on known well-established techniques for detecting community structure in complex networks, we extract and study latent subcommunities from the email social network of several projects: Apache HTTPD, Python, PostgresSQL, Perl, and Apache ANT. We then validate them with software development activity history. Our results show that subcommunities do indeed spontaneously arise within these projects as the projects evolve. These subcommunities manifest most strongly in technical discussions, and are significantly connected with collaboration behaviour.},

We reconstructed 2-mode cocollaboration networks (software developer by bug) in which a tie represents an action taken by a developer in order to solve a specific bug. Co-collaboration networks were collected at five points in time during a six-month development cycle of the software. We report and discuss results of longitudinal actor-based modeling that we specify to test for the influence of local network structures on developer's decision to take action on a specific bug. The study controls for bugspecific and developer-specific characteristics that may also affect developers' decisions exogenously. We also control for priority and severity levels assigned by the team to bugs in an attempt to manage voluntary contribution.},

  abstract = {A systems analysis perspective is adopted to examine the critical properties of the Free/Libre/Open Source Software (FLOSS) mode of innovation, as reflected on the SourceForge platform (SF.net). This approach re-scales March's (1991) framework and applies it to characterize the ``innovation system'' of a ``distributed organization'' of interacting agents in a virtual collaboration environment, rather than to innovation within a firm. March (1991) views the process of innovation at the organizational level as the coupling of sub-processes of exploration and exploitation. Correspondingly, the innovation system of the virtual collaboration environment represented by SF.net is an emergent property of two ``coupled'' processes: one involves the interactions among agents searching the locale for information and knowledge resources to use in designing novel software products (i.e., exploration), and the other involves the mobilization of individuals' capabilities for application in the software development projects that become established on the platform (i.e., exploitation). The micro-dynamics of this system are studied empirically by constructing transition probability matrices representing the movements of 222,835 SF.net users among seven different activity states, which range from ``lurking'' (not contributing or contributing to projects without becoming a member) to ``laboring'' (joining one or more projects as members), and to ``launching'' (founding one or more projects) within each successive 6-month interval. The estimated probabilities are found to form first-order Markov chains describing ergodic processes. This makes it possible the computation of the equilibrium distribution of agents among the states, thereby suppressing transient effects and revealing persisting patterns of project joining and project launching. The latter show the FLOSS innovation process on SF.net to be highly dissipative: a very large proportion of the registered ``developers'' fail to become even minimally active on the platform. There is nevertheless an active core of mobile project joiners, and a (still smaller) core of project founders who persist in creating new projects. The structure of these groups' interactions (as displayed within the 3-year period examined) is investigated in detail, and it is shown that it would be sufficient to sustain both the exploration and exploitation phases of the platform's global dynamics.},

In this paper, we analyze temporal patterns associated with Open Source Software (OSS) projects and how the contributor's notoriety grows and fades over time in a core-periphery structure. In order to explore the temporal dynamics of GitHub communities we formulate a time series clustering model using both Social Network Analysis (SNA) and technical metrics. By applying an adaptive time frame incremental approach to clustering, we locate contributors in different temporal networks. We demonstrate our approach on five long-lived OSS projects involving more than 700 contributors and found that there are three main temporal shapes of attention when contributors shift from periphery to core. Our analyses provide insights into common temporal patterns of the growing OSS communities on GitHub and broaden the understanding of the dynamics and motivation of open source contributors.},

A recurring theme in the repository mining literature is the inference of developer networks capturing e.g. collaboration, coordination, or communication from the commit history of projects. Most of the studied networks are based on the co-authorship of software artefacts. Because this neglects detailed information on code changes and code ownership we introduce git2net, a scalable python software that facilitates the extraction of fine-grained co-editing networks in large git repositories. It uses text mining techniques to analyse the detailed history of textual modifications within files. We apply our tool in two case studies using GitHub repositories of multiple Open Source as well as a commercial software project. Specifically, we use data on more than 1.2 million commits and more than 25'000 developers to test a hypothesis on the relation between developer productivity and co-editing patterns in software teams. We argue that git2net opens up a massive new source of high-resolution data on human collaboration patterns that can be used to advance theory in empirical software engineering, computational social science, and organisational studies.},

We analyse activity traces and success levels for approximately 150\,000 self-organized, online team projects. While larger teams tend to be more successful, workload is highly focused across the team, with only a few members performing most work. We find that highly successful teams are significantly more focused than average teams of the same size, that their members have worked on more diverse sets of projects, and the members of highly successful teams are more likely to be core members or `leads' of other teams. The relations between team success and size, focus and especially team experience cannot be explained by confounding factors such as team age, external contributions from non-team members, nor by group mechanisms such as social loafing. Taken together, these features point to organizational principles that may maximize the success of collaborative endeavours.},

We model the process of mutual awareness expansion using a random walk process and extract communities based on the model. We propose an interaction space based representation to quantify community dynamics.

It is also applied to data mined from some well known projects (Apache, GNOME, and KDE), focusing on the characterization of their collaboration network architecture. These cases help to understand the potentials of the methodology and how it is applied, but also shows some relevant results which open new paths in the understanding of the informal organization of libre software development communities.},

In addition, since its users can follow each other, it also forms a professional social network of millions of users. In this work, we perform a data-driven study for analyzing the GitHub network. By introducing a distributed crawling framework, we first collect profiles and behavioral data of more than 2 million GitHub users. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest and latest public dataset of GitHub. Then, we build the social graph of these users and conduct a thorough analysis of the network structure. Moreover, we investigate the user behavior patterns, particularly the patterns of the "commit" activities. Finally, we utilize machine learning methods to discover important users in the network with a high accuracy and a low overhead. Our inspiring findings are helpful for GitHub to provide better services for its users.},

In particular, participation is the most important mechanism by which the development of the project is supported. The main objective of this paper is to analyse the online participation in virtual communities using social network analysis techniques in order to obtain the main patterns of behaviour of users within communities. Several open-source communities related to Linux ports to embedded processors have been studied, obtaining a set of indicators by modelling them as a social network. Exploratory factor analysis has been used to extract the main dimensions related to the participation process. Participation inequality, hierarchy and the cohesion of the community constitute the main dimensions characterizing the participation mechanism within communities. Obtained results highlight the necessity of guiding the organization and development of the community to achieve successful target software.},

OSS communities can be modelled as a social network in which nodes represent the community members and arcs represent the social interactions among them, and factor analysis is able to provide the factors that explain the latent patterns of behaviour. Due to the complexity of the problem and the high number of SNA features that can be extracted, this paper proposes a genetic search of an optimum subset of indicators leading to a group of latent patterns of behaviour maximizing the explained data variance and the interpretation of factors. Obtained results illustrate the feasibility of the proposed framework to extract relevant information from a large set of data.},

One of the critical differences between Open Source and Proprietary Software is the communication networks. Objective: This paper tries to set a base for understanding how open source teams are structured and how they change. This is vital to understanding Open Source Software Communities. Method: The paper looks into previous research on Social Network Analysis of Open Source Software, using a systematic literature review. Papers were gathered from Scopus, IEEEXplore and ACM Digital Library, and used or discarded based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Research which focuses on the success factors of Open Source Software through Network Analysis is also examined. Results: A subjective categorisation is established for the papers: Structure, Lifecycle and Communication. It was found that the structure of a project has a large bearing on project success, with developers having previously worked together being indicative of project success. Other structure indicators of success are having a small but structured hierarchy, a diverse user and developer base, and project prominence. However, it was found that information on how these structures appear and evolve over time is lacking, and future research into temporal data models to determine project success information is suggested. Conclusions: A categorisation of existing research on Social Network Analysis is provided as a basis for further research. Further work into the lifecycle of OSS projects through Social Network Analysis of temporal project information is suggested.},

We develop several hypotheses by comparing the Apache project with several commercial projects. We then test and refine several of these hypotheses, based on an analysis of Mozilla data. We conclude with thoughts about the prospects for high-performance commercial/open source process hybrids.},

  abstract = {Social systems are in a constant state of flux, with dynamics spanning from minute-by-minute changes to patterns present on the timescale of years. Accurate models of social dynamics are important for understanding the spreading of influence or diseases, formation of friendships, and the productivity of teams. Although there has been much progress on understanding complex networks over the past decade, little is known about the regularities governing the microdynamics of social networks. Here, we explore the dynamic social network of a densely-connected population of {$\sim$}1,000 individuals and their interactions in the network of real-world person-to-person proximity measured via Bluetooth, as well as their telecommunication networks, online social media contacts, geolocation, and demographic data. These high-resolution data allow us to observe social groups directly, rendering community detection unnecessary. Starting from 5-min time slices, we uncover dynamic social structures expressed on multiple timescales. On the hourly timescale, we find that gatherings are fluid, with members coming and going, but organized via a stable core of individuals. Each core represents a social context. Cores exhibit a pattern of recurring meetings across weeks and months, each with varying degrees of regularity. Taken together, these findings provide a powerful simplification of the social network, where cores represent fundamental structures expressed with strong temporal and spatial regularity. Using this framework, we explore the complex interplay between social and geospatial behavior, documenting how the formation of cores is preceded by coordination behavior in the communication networks and demonstrating that social behavior can be predicted with high precision.},

Many times a compression of the graph to one population, namely a one mode projection (OMP), is needed in order to gain insight into one of the populations. Since this compression leads to loss of information, several works in the past attempted to quantify the connection quality between the items from the population that is being projected, but have ignored the edge weights in the bipartite graph. This paper presents a novel method to create a weighted OMP (WOMP) by taking edge weights of the bipartite graph into account. The usefulness of the method is then displayed in a case-based reasoning (CBR) environment as a local similarity measure between unordered symbols, in an attempt to solve the long-tail problem of infrequently used but significant symbols of textual CBR. It is shown that our method is superior to other similarity options.},

In contrast to close source or proprietary software, the organizational structure and task allocation in an open source project setting is unstructured. Software project managers perform risk, threat and vulnerability analysis to gain insights into the organizational structure for de-risking or risk mitigation. For example, it is important for a project manager to have an understanding of critical employees, core team, subject matter experts, sub-groups, leaders and communication bridges. Software repositories such as defect tracking systems, versioning systems and mailing lists contains a wealth of valuable information that can be mined for solving practically useful software engineering tasks. In this paper, we present a systematic approach to mine defect tracking system for risk, threat and vulnerability analysis in a software project. We derive a collaboration network from a defect tracking system and apply social network analysis techniques to investigate the derived network for the purpose of risk and vulnerability analysis. We perform empirical analysis on bug report data of Mozilla Firefox project and present the results of our analysis. We demonstrate how important information pertaining to risk and vulnerability can be uncovered using network analysis techniques from static record keeping software archive such as the bug tracking system.},

Using longitudinal data from a large online OSS community called Ohloh, we empirically examine the impacts of various factors for these two type of mechanisms on the commercial and technological successes of OSS projects. We found that preferential attachment and structure hole factors are supported, while accumulative advantage factors are partially supported.
